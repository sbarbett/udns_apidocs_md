# Resource Record Sets

A zone contains one or more Resource Records (RRs). A grouping of Resource
Records of the same type at the same domain name (for example, all A Records
at example.com.) is called a Resource Record Set (RRSet). The domain name
containing the RRSet is the owner of the RRSet; the domain name is the
ownerName.

![Closed](../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent.gif)Resource
Record Set (RRSet) DTO

The basic unit for resource record manipulation in the REST API is the RRSet.
An RRSet contains the data for all resource records present at the same owner
name (label), and with the same type and class (all records in UltraDNS have
IN class).

  * The UltraDNS REST API enforces the same TTL for all records in an RRSet (with the exception of a directional pool).

  * Rather than trying to specify a custom structure for each different resource record type, the data for all resource records is represented by an "rdata" field. This field's contents map to the data supplied in the BIND presentation format for a resource record.

  * If an RRSet is associated with an UltraDNS pool, the âprofileâ field is present and contains pool specific attributes.

The RRSet DTO is used in the List (GET), Create (POST), and Update (PATCH)
RRSets API calls. When a user is submitting an RRSet DTO to the server, the
owner name and rrtype are not required, because they are specified by the URI.
If present, they will be ignored.

RRSet DTO

Attribute |  Description |  Type |  Required?  
---|---|---|---  
ownerName |  The domain name of the owner of the RRSet. Can be either:

  * Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)
  * Relative Domain Name

If a FQDN, it must be contained within the zone name FQDN. |  String. |  NO for PUT, POST, or PATCH calls. Ignored if present. Not present (and ignored if present) if this RRSet is embedded inside of an Owner structure.  
rrtype |  Resource Record Type for the RRSet. Must be formatted as the well-known resource record type (A, AAAA, TXT, etc.) and the corresponding number for the type, between 1 and 65535 or a known resource record name (A, AAAA, SRV, etc.). |  String. |  NO for PUT, POST, or PATCH calls. Ignored if present. Not present (and ignored if present) if this RRSet is embedded inside of an Owner structure.  
ttl |  The time to live (in seconds) for all records in the RRSet. Must be a value between 0 and 2147483647, inclusive. |  Integer. |  Should be included in PUT, POST or PATCH calls.  If TTL is not specified, the value set at the account level (either for record type or global setting) will be used.  
rdata |  The data for the records in the RRSet. Must use the BIND presentation format for the specified rrtype. For MX, NS, CNAME, PTR, and APEXALIAS record types, the rdata value cannot be relative to the zone name. It must be a FQDN. If rrtype is MX, entering â0 .â will create a NULL MX record, implying that âNo Serviceâ is available for the server / record. |  Array. |  REQUIRED for PUT, POST, or PATCH calls. Must include BIND formatted data.

  * Multiple non-Null MX records with the same domain/host label are supported.
  * Only 1 Null-MX record is supported per domain/host.
  * A domain/host cannot contain both Null and Non-Null MX records.

  
systemGenerated |  Indicates whether the record in an rdata list is system generated or not.  It represents the Boolean value that corresponds to the record in the list (in same order the records are returned). |  Array (Boolean). |  Will be returned for GET requests when used as the query parameter systemGeneratedStatus.  If the query parameter is set to true, then the attribute name will be returned in the response.  Ignored for PUT/PATCH/POST requests.  
ultra2SystemGenerated  |  Indicates whether the nameserver in an rdata list is generated by the Ultra2 system or not. |  Array (Boolean) corresponding to the nameserver in the list. |  ultra2SystemGenerated will only be returned for those accounts which have Ultra2 enabled, as well as the associated NS records.

![Closed](../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent.gif)List all
RRSets by Type

This call allows you to list all RRSets of a particular Record type for a
specified zone. This differs from the above List all RRSets in a Zone because
the above call returns RRSets of records based on the kind of set or pool,
while this call returns RRSets based on the record type.

The Type can be a DNS record name (for example A, TXT, AAAA, SRV), or a number
value that corresponds to a resource record type.

Method and URI:

GET https://api.ultradns.com/zones/{zoneName}/rrsets/{recordType}

OR

GET https://api.ultradns.com/zones/{zoneName}/rrsets/{recordTypeNumber}

URL Example: List All RRSets of Type A in a Zone

https://api.ultradns.com/zones/example.com/rrsets/A

This returns all A records in the zone example.com.

URL Example: List All RRSets of Type 16 (TXT) in a Zone

https://api.ultradns.com/zones/example.com/rrsets/16

This returns all TXT (resource record type code 16) in the zone example.com.

**Parameters** : List RRsets in Zone in zone lists the parameters available to
be sent with the call.

**Body** : None

**Response** : If task completes, Status Code 200 OK is returned with an
RRSetList DTOin the body content, containing only RRSets of the specified
type.

**Errors** : An error is returned under the following conditions:

  * If {zoneName} is not valid.

  * If you don't have permission to read zones.

  * If type is invalid.

![Closed](../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent.gif)List all
RRSets of a Type for an Owner

This call returns a list of RRSets of a specified type for the Owner Name
provided in the call.

The identified Type can be any of the following:

  * A DNS record-type name (A, TXT, AAAA, SRV),

  * A number corresponding to a resource record type (from 1 to 65535). 

OR  

  * The special reserved word "ANY", which will return all RRSets for the specified owner name.

_Owner name_ can be a relative name (does not include the zone name), or an
absolute name (includes the zone name).

Note the following about owner names and constructing this call:

  * Using a **q** query parameter with an owner name is automatically a string-match search; it will return all owner names that contain the specified string.

  * When the owner name is specified as part of the URI, the search will return only the RRSets for the owner name that exactly matches the specified name. 

See the examples listed below for more information.

The list all RRSets of a type for an owner is a GET call and is constructed as
follows:

**Method and URI** :

GET https://api.ultradns.com/zones/{zoneName}/rrsets/{type}/{ownerName}

![Closed](../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent.gif)Example List
RRSets of a Type for an Owner: Methods and Results

For the following example calls, assume there are A-type records defined at
_test1.domain.name_ , _test2.domain.name_ , and _test.domain.name_. Different
call construction will return different results.

URL Example 1: Return all A-type RRSets across *test*.domain.com

For the identified example scenario, the following call returns A-type
Resource Record Sets for all three domain.name zones where the owner name
contains the string âtestâ:

https://api.ultradns.com/zones/domain.name/rrsets/A?q=owner:test

URL Example 2: Return all A-type RRSets for âtest.domain.comâ only

If you construct the call using the same âtestâ string as the owner name,
but in the URL instead of as a query parameter, the call looks as follows and
returns only the resource record set for test.domain.com.

https://api.ultradns.com/zones/domain.name/rrsets/A/test

For getting the systemGenerated attribute in an RRSet response, the following
query parameter needs to be provided:

https://api.ultradns.com/zones/domain.name/rrsets/A/test?systemGeneratedStatus=true

URL Example 3: Return all RRSets for âtest.domain.comâ only

Using the âANYâ term for {type} in the call returns all RRSets for the
specified zone. The following two examples will return the same results. The
first contains an absolute owner name, including the domain name; the second
contains a relative owner name, without the domain name.

https://api.ultradns.com/zones/domain.name./rrsets/ANY/test.domain.name  

https://api.ultradns.com/zones/domain.name/rrsets/ANY/test

**Parameters** : None

**Body** : None

**Response** : If task completes, Status Code 200 OK is returned with an
RRSetList DTO in the body content.

JSON Example: Returned records list for ownerName test.domain.name

{

],  
}  
],  
}

**Errors** : An error is returned under the following conditions:

  * If {zoneName} is not valid.

  * If you don't have permission to read zones.

  * If type is invalid.

  * If {ownerName} does not exist.

![Closed](../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent.gif)Create RRSet
for an Owner

The Create RRSet for an Owner call requires you to send an Resource Record Set
(RRSet) DTO with the call. However, the ownerName and rrtype fields are not
required because they are specified in the URI. If the DTO you send does
include them, they will be ignored.

**Method and URI** :

POST https://api.ultradns.com/zones/{zoneName}/rrsets/{type}/{ownerName}

URL Example: Create an A-type RRSet for owner test.domain.name

https://api.ultradns.com/zones/domain.name./rrsets/A/test

The above example creates an A-type resource record set for the owner
test.domain.name.

**Parameters** : None

**Body** : Must include an Resource Record Set (RRSet) DTO.

JSON Example: RRSet DTO for an A-type RRSet for test.domain.name

{  
"ttl": 300,  
"rdata": [  
"1.2.3.4"  
]  
}

**Response** : If creation happens immediately, Status Code 201 is returned
with an appropriate status message in the response body.

  * If creation happens in the background, a Status Code 202 is returned with a status message of âPendingâ, along with an X-Task-Id header in body content.

**Errors** : An error is returned under the following conditions:

  * If {zoneName} is not valid.

  * If you don't have permission to write records.

  * If {type} is invalid.

  * If {ownerName} is not a valid name.

![Closed](../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent.gif)Create Zone
via BIND File Upload

This call creates a Zone, rather than individual records within a Zone. The
Zone details must be attached in a BIND file, and attached in the body of the
call when sent.

![](../Resources/Images/Rest-API_User_Guide/Introduction_57x65.png) |  **New Update** â The BIND Upload of zone feature now supports the usage of whitespaces as a hostname in the BIND file. Referring to [RFC-1035](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035), newly supported behavior is described as follows â âIf an entry for an RR begins with a blank, then the RR is assumed to be owned by the last stated owner. If an RR entry begins with a <domain-name>, then the owner name is reset.â  
---|---  
  
**Method and URI** :

PATCH https://api.ultradns.com/zones/{zoneName}/rrsets

**Parameters** : Requires Resource Record Set (RRSet) DTO

**Body** : You will need to upload/provide the partial BIND file location by
changing the **KEY** parameter to File, and then the **Content-Type** as
multipart/form-data. Click on the **Select Files** button to upload your BIND
file.

**Response** : Task should happen in the background, returning a Status Code
202 along with an X-Task-ID header and status message of âPendingâ in the
body content.

**Errors** : An error is returned under the following conditions:

  * If {zoneName} does not exist.

  * If you do not have permission to update {zoneName}.

Do not add any JSON content or BIND file content as text in the request body.

**Response** : Task should happen in the background, returning a Status Code
202 along with an X-Task-ID header and status message of âPendingâ in the
body content.

**Errors** : An error is returned under the following conditions:

  * If {zoneName} does not exist.

  * If you do not have permission to update {zoneName}.

![Closed](../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent.gif)Update an
RRSet

This call allows you to update a set of resource records of a particular type
(an RRSet) for a specified domain owner.

Be sure to specify the TTL and ALL of the record information. Any resource
records not included will be removed from the RRSet, and the TTL value
specified at the account level for the record type (or global TTL value) will
be used.

**Method and URI** :

PUT https://api.ultradns.com/zones/{zoneName}/rrsets/{type}/{ownerName}

**Parameters** : None

**Body** : Must include an Resource Record Set (RRSet) DTO.

**Response** : If task completes, Status Code 200 OK is returned with an
appropriate status message in the response body.

  * If task happens in the background, Status Code 202 is returned along with an X-Task-ID header and status message of Pending in the body content.

**Errors** : An error is returned under the following conditions:

  * If {zoneName} is not valid.

  * If you don't have permission to update records.

  * If type is invalid.

  * If {ownerName} does not exist.

![Closed](../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent.gif)Partially
Update an RRSet

This call allows you to update some of the information in a set of resource
records of a particular type (an RRSet) for a specified domain owner.

This differs from the Update RRSet call in two ways:

  1. If you do not specify the TTL, the existing TTL will continue to be used.

  2. Any resource records specified will be added to the RRSet. Existing records are not modified or removed (except for A and CNAME records; see below note.).

![](../Resources/Images/Rest-API_User_Guide/Resource Record Sets_1_62x63.png) |  There is a special case for A and CNAME resource records. Since only a single resource record is allowed in an A or CNAME RRSet, if you perform a partial update, you will modify the single resource record.  
---|---  
  
**Method and URI** :

PATCH https://api.ultradns.com/zones/{zoneName}/rrsets/{type}/{ownerName}

**Parameters** : None

**Body** : For standard XML or JSON calls, you must include an Resource Record
Set (RRSet) DTO.

For [JSON PATCH Examples](Making Updates via JSON
PATCH.htm#JSON_PATCH_EXAMPLES), the body must include a [JSON PATCH
DTO](Making Updates via JSON PATCH.htm#JSON_PATCH_DTO).

Patchable Objects for Resource Records:

  * biz.example.ultra.rest.dto.RRSet

  * biz.example.ultra.rest.dto.RRSet.List<String>

An Rdata element value can be patched if the index has identified each value
delimited by a space in the string. Refer to the below example.

JSON Example: Update only the mail server name in the 1st MX record, or
replace all values in 2nd MX record for rdata ["10 mail1.json-patch-rr-set-pr-
zone.com.", "20 mail1.json-patch-rr-set-pr-zone.com."]

[  
{  
"op": "replace",  
"path": "/rdata/0/1",  
"value": "new.mail.server.biz."  
},  
{  
"op" : "replace",  
"path": "/rdata/1",  
"value": "30 new3.mail.server.biz"  
}  
]

**Response** : If task completes, Status Code 200 OK is returned with an
appropriate status message in the response body.

  * If task happens in the background, Status Code 202 is returned along with an X-Task-ID header and status message of Pending in the body content.

**Errors** : An error is returned under the following conditions:

  * If {zoneName} is not valid.

  * If {ownerName} does not exist.

  * If you don't have permission to update records.

  * If {type} is invalid.

  * If patch operation is not allowed for the given JSON pointer value.

## TTL Records Consistency in Resource Records Set

Per [RFC 2181](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2181), the Time to Live (TTL) of
all Resource Records in an RRSet must be the same value. For RRSets that (can)
have multiple records and the same owner and type, the TTL behavior will act
as follows.

![Closed](../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent.gif)Updating the
TTL of Records via PATCH Request

Whenever a TTL value of an existing record in an RRSet is modified using a
Partial Update (PATCH) request, the other records will also be updated to the
newly modified TTL value. This will also create an Audit entry for each record
that is being modified.

For example, the following three records are of owner âtxtrecordâ and type
âTXTâ, with rdata details and TTL values.

  1. txtrecorddata1 with TTL 300
  2. txtrecorddata2 with TTL 500
  3. txtrecorddata3 with TTL 400

Now, when you update the record with txtrecorddata1 to TTL value of 600, the
other two rdata records will also update their TTL values to the new 600
value.

![Closed](../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent.gif)Updating the
TTL of Records via PATCH BIND File

If you are performing an update via a BIND file that contains multiple records
for an RRSet (same owner and type) with different TTL values for each record,
then each record will be created with the lowest TTL value amongst those RRset
records in the BIND file.

For example, the following three records are of an owner âtxtrecordâ and
type âTXTâ, with rdata details and varying TTL values.

  1. txtrecorddata1 with TTL value 300
  2. txtrecorddata2 with TTL value 500
  3. txtrecorddata3 with TTL value 400

Once the update is completed, each RRSet record will have a TTL value of 300.

![Closed](../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent.gif)Creating a
New Record via Bind Upload

When you are creating a new record for an Owner and Type via a Bind upload, if
the TTL value is not provided in the request, and there are pre-existing
records for this specific Owner and Type, the REST API will create a new
record with a TTL value that matches the lowest common TLL value amongst the
existing records (of the same Owner and Type).

If there are no pre-existing records for the Owner and Type, and a TTL value
is not provided at the time of the Bind upload, then the TTL value will be set
to the default value.

For example, the following three existing records are of Owner âtxtrecordâ
and Type TXT, with rdata details and TTL values.

  1. txtrecorddata1 with TTL 300
  2. txtrecorddata2 with TTL 500
  3. txtrecorddata with TTL 400

Now, when you create the new record for the same Owner and Type via Bind
upload, the new records will have TTL value(s) of 300, and any of the pre-
existing records for the same Owner and Type will have the TTL values updated
to 300.

When you are creating a new record for an Owner and Type via a Bind upload, if
the TTL value is provided in the request, and there are pre-existing records
for this specific Owner and Type, the REST API will create new records with
the provided TTL value, and will also update the TTL value of the pre-existing
records (of the same Owner and Type) with the new TTL value being provided.

For example, the following three pre-existing records are of Owner
âtxtrecordâ and Type TXT, with rdata details and TTL values:

  1. txtrecorddata with TTL 300
  2. txtrecorddata with TTL 500
  3. txtrecorddata with TTL 400

Once the upload is complete, the three RRSet records above will be created
with a TTL value of 300, and all the of the pre-existing records for the Owner
and Type will also be updated to the TTL value of 300.

![Closed](../../Skins/Default/Stylesheets/Images/transparent.gif)Updating the
TTL of Records via a POST Request

When you are creating a new record for an Owner and Type, if the TTL value is
not provided in the request, and there are no pre-existing records for the
specific Owner and Type, then the new record will be created with the default
TTL value (86400).

For example, if you add a record of Owner âtxtrecordâ and Type TXT but
without a TTL value, the record will be assigned the TTL value of 86400.

When you are creating a new record for an Owner and Type, if the TTL is
provided in the request and there are pre-existing records for the specified
Owner and Type, the REST API will create a new record with the provided TTL
value, and will also update the TTL value of the pre-existing records to the
new TTL value.

For example, the following three pre-existing records are of Owner
âtxtrecordâ and Type TXT, with rdata details and TTL values:

  1. txtrecorddata1 with TTL 300
  2. txtrecorddata2 with TTL 500
  3. txtrecorddata3 with TTL 400

If you add the new record with the TTL value of 700 via the POST request, all
of the above mentioned pre-existing records will update their TTL value to 700
as well.

When you are creating a new record for an Owner and Type, if the TTL value is
not provided in the request, and there are pre-existing records for the
specified Owner and Type, the REST API will create a new record with the
lowest TTL value amongst the pre-existing records of the specified Owner and
Type.

For example, the following three pre-existing records are of Owner
âtxtrecordâ and Type TXT, with rdata details and TTL values:

  1. txtrecorddata1 with TTL 300
  2. txtrecorddata2 with TTL 500
  3. txtrecorddata3 with TTL 400

If you add a new record without providing the TTL value via a POST request,
the new record will be added with the lowest TTL value from the pre-existing
records, so in this scenario, the TTL value 300.
